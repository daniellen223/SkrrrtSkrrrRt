Solves using a single layer neural network, with regression and a basis function as per chapter 4 in Bishop 
A special interest on missing data
'''

# Load data


# Transform data into manageable form



# Split data into training_data, training_targets, test_data & test_targets


# Initialize neural network


# Train neural network on training set


# Test neural network on test set, log errors


# Plot results


# For when the above code is already working, implement the following:
#-----------------------------------------
# Train with complete data, test with complete data
# Train with complete data, test with incomplete data
# Train with incomplete data, test with complete data
# Train with incomplete data, test with incomplete data
